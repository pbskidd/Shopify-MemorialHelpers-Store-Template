# Shopify-MemorialHelpers Store Template
 
This is a custom Shopify Template I designed based on the "California" theme. 
Sweeping changes were made to the original theme including replacing most of the original CSS and making many changes to the Liqiud, PHP and JavaScript code.  I added customer tracking and autofill code as well as the ability to add customization instructions to each of an unrestricted (n) products and then transmit that information cleanly from the cart to the order record and the fulfillment notifications.

This store has been used successfully in production for a number of years already.
